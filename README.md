#### By **Alex Wambugu**
## Description
- This is a simple website where users can easily find their Ghanain Akan Names either from the list provided, or by inserting their day of birth. If the user is not sure of the day of the week on which they were born, then the application calculates this day from the date of birth provided. The application then uses this information plus the users gender to find that users Akan name.
