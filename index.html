				<p class="card-text">Hi there and welcome to our Akan Names page. Have you heard of Akan Names? These are traditional Ghanain names that are given to a person based on their gender and the day of the week. Different names are given to a person depending on the day of the week on which they were born.
					Thus, as long as you know the day of the week on which you were born, then you can easily find your Akan name.
